/*
 * First started with requirement 1, and tried to see how I can fix a null
 * pointer exception. I found that I can't pass a string with letters as an int,
 * so I made sure that the null pointer exception was caught, and I called
 * another method to make sure that if the file had any letters in it, then the
 * program would ignore it and go on to convert the numbers from the file. I
 * then decided to rename the null pointer exception to
 * CannotConvertFromStringToInt Exception. I then moved on to requirement two, I
 * decided to copy a text file from lab 5 with 45 students over to lab 6. I
 * tried making the student array, but I kept getting null pointer exceptions.
 * Then I figured out that I had to set each student grade in the array equal to
 * one instance of a student grade. I then managed to find out how to serialize
 * data into a file. At first I was doing individual integers and floats, but
 * then I realized that I had to do a student grade array. while I was able to
 * create an array, I noticed that the only values serialized in a file were the
 * values from the last student. So what I did was put the declarations of the
 * values for student grade in the serialize student grade method, and that
 * helped fix things. Part 3 was a little easy to figure out because part 2 was
 * just like it, but I had to deserialize the values. I had trouble trying to
 * print out all of the values because I couldn't get student grade to equal
 * anything after I deserialized it. So I set stg equal to the deserialized
 * method as it returns student grade. I then put the print scores and print
 * stats methods in a loop, and printed out the scores and stats for each
 * student. Setting up the abstract class and interface was easy while working
 * on the lab.
